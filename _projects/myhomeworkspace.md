# What is it?
MyHomeworkSpace is an online homework planner I developed with some [friends from high school](https://myhomework.space/about.html). You can save your homework and other events in the planner, and it becomes accessible anywhere you go. It also connects with my school's scheduling system, automatically pulling your class schedule data and displaying it side-by-side with events that you add.

# Why was it made?
I wanted to see if it was possible to take the paper planner the school offered and digitize it, like I digitized my notes with NoteToScreen. There had already been an [Online Planbook](https://github.com/davish/Planbook) created by another student, but I wasn't happy with the features it offered, so I decided to make my own.

# What am I proud of?
Since its start, MyHomeworkSpace has grown to serving over 300 members of the my high school's community, and has expanded to support automatic import of MIT students' schedules&mdash;though anyone can use the website, even without any school affiliation.
