## What is it?
DaltonTab is a replacement for your new tab page, developed by [a bunch of Dalton students](https://github.com/ULTIMATHEXERS/DaltonTab/graphs/contributors), that lets you easily view your homework, schedules, classes, and more! It automatically retrieves your data from MyHomeworkSpace and other Dalton sites, and even brings you a different background every day!

## Why was it made?
Originally, it was a project, started by @willbarkoff, for the [TigerHacks 2015](https://web.archive.org/web/20170707221701/http://www.tigerhacks.com/) hackathon hosted by my school.

## What am I proud of?
While it was initially a project intended specifically for the hackathon, it is a useful product and we've been able to maintain and expand it since then, releasing several updates containing significant feature improvements, something which I don't think is the case for many hackathon projects.
