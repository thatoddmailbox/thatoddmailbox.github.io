## What is it?
CoursesPlus was a Chrome extension that took the Courses website, which my school used for teachers to post homework and assignments, and extended it. The extension provided extensive customization options for almost every page on the site, and also added several useful features, such as the ability to hide events.

## Why was it made?
I wasn't very happy with the look and feel of the Courses website, so I made some tweaks to the CSS, and realized that I could package these tweaks up as an extension, allowing me to easily distribute them to other students.

## What am I proud of?
While it has become useless with the death of the Courses website, CoursesPlus had a long lifetime, with built-in analytics showing that, during its life, the extension's code was cumulatively run over half a million times.
