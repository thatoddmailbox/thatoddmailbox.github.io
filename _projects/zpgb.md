## What is it?
Zum Puzzler Pocket is a game I wrote. It was developed entirely in assembly language, and runs on a Nintendo Gameboy Color. (In fact, I produced a cartridge of it, which actually worked on a real Gameboy!)

## Why was it made?
I've created almost a tradition of sorts in my family, creating a new game as a gift for my sister's birthday every year. Zum Puzzler Pocket was one of these games, the next installment in this series.

## What am I proud of?
Not only did I write the entire game in assembly language, but I wrote my own assembler, [gbasm](https://github.com/thatoddmailbox/gbasm), specifically for developing Gameboy games. I'm very proud of the fact that I was able to take a system that I had basically zero prior experience with (knowing very little about the system's processor, its assembly language, or its graphics hardware), create a fully-functional game (complete with my own tooling!), and produce a working, physical cartridge. The project was also a learning experience for me, helping me understand concepts and develop skills that could be used in future projects, like my [Soviet computer replica](https://alex.studer.dev/2019/02/04/computer).
